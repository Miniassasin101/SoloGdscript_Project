class_name BypassArmorEffect extends SpecialEffect

"""
Description:
	On a critical the attacker finds a gap in the defenderâ€™s natural or
worn armour. If the defender is wearing armour above natural protection, then the attacker must decide which of the two is bypassed.
This effect can be stacked to bypass both. For the purposes of this
effect, physical protection gained from magic is considered as being
worn armour.

This only can be activated by an attacking unit if the attacking unit 
scores a critical on their attack (2 success level)

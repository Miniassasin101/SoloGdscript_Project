class_name BashEffect extends SpecialEffect

"""
Description:
	The attacker deliberately bashes the opponent off balance. How far
the defender totters back or sideward depends on the weapon being
used. Shields knock an opponent back one metre per for every two
points of damage rolled (prior to any subtractions due to armour,
parries, and so forth), whereas bludgeoning weapons knock back one
metre per for every three points. Bashing works only on creatures up
to twice the attackerâ€™s SIZ. If the recipient is forced backwards into
an obstacle, then they must make a Hard Athletics or Acrobatics skill
roll to avoid falling or tripping over.

## This condition is immidiately applied, and will also handle what happens when the unit crashes into a wall.
## This solves several potential issues with the movement negatively affecting other special effect resolutions

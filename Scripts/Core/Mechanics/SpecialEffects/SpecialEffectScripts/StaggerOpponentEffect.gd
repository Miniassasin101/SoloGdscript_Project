class_name StaggerOpponentEffect extends SpecialEffect

"""
Description:
	The character attempts to knock his opponent off-balance or 
break their stance. The opponent must make an opposed roll of his Brawn,
Evade or Acrobatics against the characterâ€™s original roll. If the target
fails, he becomes staggered. Quadruped opponents (or creatures with even
more legs) may substitute their Athletics skill for Evade, and treat the
roll as one difficulty grade easier
